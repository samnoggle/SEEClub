		The club goes on three field trips outside of the school day. They are a fall hike, indoor rock climbing
		in the winter and a spring hike. As well as going on field trips the club; distributes information about
		earth day, participates in the fall picnic and lock-in, and weeds and plants flowers around the school.
		This year the club is also hoping to increase participation in recycling.">
